# Bayesian Adaptive Superpixel Segmentation

This is the official code for our ICCV 2019 paper, ["Bayesian Adaptive Superpixel Segmentation"](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~orenfr/BASS/Uziel_ICCV_2019.pdf) , co-authored by Roy Uziel, Meitar Ronen, and Oren Freifeld.

You can run the code using either GPU or CPU.

Remark (17/4/2020): we are currently working on an even faster GPU implementation. 

# Installation

The code uses Python 3.6 and it was tested on Pytorch 1.3.0

Install pip and virtualenv
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv
```

Clone the git project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/BASS.git
```

Set up virtual environment:
```
$ mkdir <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs
$ virtualenv -p python3 <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs/BASS
```

Activate virtual environment:
```
$ cd BASS
$ source <your_home_dir>/BASS/bin/activate
```

The requirements can be installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

Saving csv file
```
python BASS.py --img_folder /path/to/image/folder --csv
```
Saving mean colors and contours images
```
python BASS.py --img_folder /path/to/image/folder --vis
```
Run without gpu
```
python BASS.py --img_folder /path/to/image/folder --cpu
```
Run in verbose mode
```
python BASS.py --img_folder /path/to/image/folder --v
```
